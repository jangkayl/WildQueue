🎓 CIT University Queue Management System 📲

📌 Overview

Welcome to our Capstone Project for Object-Oriented Programming 2 — a **Queue Management System** designed specifically for **CIT University**. With long queues being a daily struggle for students and administrative staff alike, we envisioned a system that transforms the traditional manual queuing process into a **smart, streamlined, and student-friendly digital experience**.

Our system is built on solid OOP foundations and leverages real-world abstractions like users, transactions, and roles (admin, student, teller) to deliver a highly maintainable and scalable application. This is more than just a queue manager — it’s a **digital concierge** for a better campus experience. ⏱️✨

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

💡 Problem Statement

Whether it's paying fees, submitting documents, or seeking student services, the queues at CIT University can be time-consuming and inefficient. This leads to:
- Lost time for students and staff
- Difficulty in managing service priorities
- Poor tracking of transactions
- Increased workload on tellers

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🚀 Solution

Our **Queue Management System** aims to **automate and optimize** the flow of students in various service windows across campus. Using unique **priority numbers**, role-based actions, and transaction history tracking, our system offers:
- Hassle-free **digital queueing**
- Role-specific functionalities for **students**, **tellers**, and **admins**
- A secure login and registration system
- Transparent and organized transaction logs
- Real-time priority updates

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

⚙️ Key Features

- 🔐 **Secure Authentication**: Role-based login for students, tellers, and admins.
- ⏳ **Smart Queue Generation**: Priority numbers issued based on availability and queue flow.
- 📈 **Transaction Monitoring**: Every action is logged with timestamps for admin reporting.
- 🖥️ **Timeout Requests**: Tellers can flag timeouts when students are absent from their turn.
- 🧾 **Real-Time Notifications**: Students receive status updates about their position in line.
- 🧑‍💼 **Admin Controls**: Admins can add, remove, and monitor user and transaction activity.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

🏛️ Why It Matters (Impact)

This project isn’t just an academic requirement — it’s a **real solution for a real problem** at CIT University. By digitizing queues:
- Students can avoid physically lining up and wait comfortably
- Tellers can operate efficiently with fewer interruptions
- Admins gain visibility into system usage and bottlenecks
- Overall service quality improves across the campus
